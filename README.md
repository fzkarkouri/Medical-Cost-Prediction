This Jupyter Notebook is inspired by the **Kaggle** dataset: ***Medical Cost Personal Datasets, Insurance Forecast by using Linear Regression***. The objective of this study is to try to accurately predict the insurance cost of individuals based on their (Age, Sex, Body mass index, Number of children covered by health insurance, Smoking habits, Residential area)


We will organize our work in sections as follow :

- Data: Where we will retrieve the data and define the variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Where we will analyze the features, their relationship with the target variable, and their respective inter-features correlations
- Predictions: Where we will test the different regression models, select for each the most important features, and tune its parameters.
- Results: Where we will discuss the results.
- Conclusion: Where we will summarize our work and state any possible improvements.

In this study, I was able to reach a coefficient of determination equal to 0.9 by using the ensemble model **Gradient Boosting Regression**. <br>

This NoteBook allowed me to dive deeper into regression algorithms and better understand the parameters and how they affect the fitting of predictions. I was able to practice EDA technics and get more at ease with hypothesis testing.
